## VerdeBot

Monitoring, Detect Contamination and a Timeline to help keep your daily tasks and projections in check.
Using PlantDoc an extensive Green Plant disease dataset capable of finding Plant diseases with upto 59% Accuracy on ImageNet

# Computer Vision and AI
Computer vision plays a pivotal role in these setups by enabling real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and data-driven decision-making, ensuring optimal growth conditions for crops in terrestrial and space-based environments. It acts as the vigilant eye that never sleeps, offering continuous insights that humans might overlook, enhancing agricultural efficiency and sustainability.
